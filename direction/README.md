- Ensemble models over different backbones.
- Main backbone model: Dino V2 from Facebook Research, Swin model, Convnext_tiny etc.
- CSVs were generated from each model and then ensembled.
- The ensemble was done using the average of the predictions from each model.
- Data augmentation and other some techniques are used to improve the performance of the model.
